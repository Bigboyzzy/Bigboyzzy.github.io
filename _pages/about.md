I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [NESLab](https://www.neslab.it/) at Politecnico di Milano, working with [Prof. Luca Mottola](https://mottola.faculty.polimi.it/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2024, advised by [Prof. Jie Liu](https://drjieliu.github.io/) (IEEE Fellow, ACM Distinguished Scientist). 
<!--  I also work closely with [Prof. Yang Zhao](https://yangece.github.io/) at Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen). -->

My main research interest is edge computing, embedded intelligence, with a focus on high-performance and energy-efficent edge DNN inference.

- DNN Compilation Optimization ([POS](https://Bigboyzzy.github.io/assets/pdf/POS_IPSN.pdf), [TOP](https://Bigboyzzy.github.io/assets/pdf/TPDS-TOP.pdf))
- Task Scheduling and Resource Allocation ([Octopus](https://Bigboyzzy.github.io/assets/pdf/ICSOC.pdf), [BCEdge](https://Bigboyzzy.github.io/assets/pdf/BCEdge_TNSM.pdf), [ECSRL](https://Bigboyzzy.github.io/assets/pdf/ECSRL_SenSys.pdf))
- Collaborative AI ([DVFO](https://Bigboyzzy.github.io/assets/pdf/DVFO_TMC.pdf))
- Energy-efficient DNN inference ([E4](https://Bigboyzzy.github.io/assets/pdf/AAAI_E4.pdf), [E3](https://Bigboyzzy.github.io/assets/pdf/E3_sensys25.pdf))
